**For Team Members Using the Break Tracker**

## 🎯 What is Punch Bot?

Punch Bot is a **fun, sarcastic Telegram bot** that tracks when you take breaks. 

Just tell the bot when you're taking a break, and it keeps track of:
- How long you were away
- What type of break you took
- How many breaks you've had today
- Whether you went over time

The bot responds with **funny, themed messages** to keep things lighthearted! 😄

---

## ✨ The Sarcasm

Each break type has its own personality:

- 🚽 **WC** - Bathroom humor (porcelain throne jokes)
- 🚬 **CY** - Chill vibes (relaxation humor)
- 💩 **BWC** - Epic battle vibes (boss fight theme)
- 🍳 **CF+1** - Breakfast humor (food quest theme)
- 🍽️ **CF+2** - Lunch humor (feast theme)
- 🍴 **CF+3** - Dinner humor (fine dining theme)

**Example responses:**
- ✅ When you START: *"🚽 Entering the porcelain portal…"*
- ✅ When you END: *"🚽 The pipes thank you."*
- ✅ When you're LATE: *"🚽 At this point, you live there now."*

It's funny, not mean! The sarcasm encourages you to actually come back on time. 😄

## 💬 How to Use - Commands

### 1️⃣ START A BREAK

Just type the **break code** and hit send:

```
wc          (10 min bathroom break)
cy          (10 min smoke break)
bwc         (20 min big bathroom break)
cf+1        (20 min breakfast)
cf+2        (30 min lunch)
cf+3        (30 min dinner)
```

**What happens:**
- Bot confirms your break with a funny message
- You appear as "ON BREAK" in the system
- Timer starts counting
- You have `[X]` breaks left for today (if you have a daily limit)

**Example:**
```
You: wc
Bot: 🚽 Bathroom run initiated… Godspeed 🚽
     ⏱️ Waste Control (10 min)
     📊 Status: OK | 1/3 used today
```

---

### 2️⃣ END A BREAK

When you're back, type ANY of these:

```
back
b
1
btw
back to work
```

**What happens:**
- Bot calculates how long you were gone
- Marks break as complete
- Sends welcome back message
- Shows actual time vs expected time

**Example:**
```
You: back
Bot: 🧻 Welcome back! You survived 😌
     ⏱️ Expected: 10min
     📊 Actual: 8min
     (2min under)
```

---

### 3️⃣ CANCEL A BREAK

If you need to cancel/undo a break, type:

```
c
cancel
reset
```

**What happens:**
- Current break is deleted
- You get a sarcasm roast about cancelling
- No record kept

```
You: c
Bot: ❌ Wc break cancelled!
```

## ⚠️ Important Rules

### Daily Limits
Each break type has a limit per day:

| Break | Limit | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| wc | 3/day | Max 3 bathroom breaks |
| cy | 3/day | Max 3 smoke breaks |
| bwc | 3/day | Max 3 big bathroom breaks |
| cf+1 | 1/day | Only 1 breakfast |
| cf+2 | 1/day | Only 1 lunch |
| cf+3 | 1/day | Only 1 dinner |

**If you hit the limit:**
```
You: wc
Bot: 🛑 That's your limit for wc today.
```

### Grace Period (⏰ Important!)
- If you take longer than expected, you get a **5-minute grace period**
- After that, the bot **automatically punches you back**
- You'll get a warning message
- The break is marked as "⚠️ OVER TIME"

**Example:**
```
You took a 10-min break but stayed 18 minutes
Bot (auto): 🚽 You okay in there? It's been a while 👀
            ⏱️ Expected: 10min
            📊 Actual: 18min
            🚨 Over by 8min!
```

### No Duplicates
**Can't start a new break while one is active!**

```
You: wc         (starts break)
You: cy         (tries to start another)
Bot: 🤨 You already have an active break!
     Active: wc (15:30:45)
     Type "back" to close it first!
```

**Solution**: End current break first with `back`, then start a new one.
